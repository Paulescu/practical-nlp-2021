# Practical NLP with PyTorch
## Become a productive NLP engineer

This course focuses on real-world applications of NLP models. To successfully apply
cutting-edge NLP models for your problems, you need to 

Very practical course. At the end of this course you will be able 
to develop and deploy production grade NLP based software.

To successfully apply NLP in real-world applications, you need to have the skills
to use all the great ML research publicly available efficiently.

This course is addressed to data scientists and machine learning engineers who
need to learn quickly how to take advantage of cutting edge NLP research
on their workplace.

**Note**: This is not a course for beginners in Machine Learning.
I assume the following:
- You know what a neural network is.
- You are familiar with the Python language. You do not need to
be proficient.
- You have implemented at least one neural network model yourself (even a simple 1-layer
dense network) using either PyTorch of Tensorflow. You do not need to be proficient
in any of these 2 frameworks.


## 1. Basic concepts in modern NLP

- Word embeddings: word2vec, GloVe
- Sentence/document embeddings


## 2. Deep learning models for NLP

- LSTM
- ELMO: Bidirectional LSTM
- The Transformer
- OpenAIGPT
- BERT
- OpenAIGPT2

## 3. Crash course on PyTorch

`RuntimeError: CUDA out of memory`

## 4. Fine-tunning NLP models
Goal: accuracy.

## 5. Storing NLP models


## 6. Optimize models for inference/deployment
Goal: accuracy and speed.

Topics:
- Quantization
