# Practical NLP in 2021
## Become a productive NLP engineer

This course focuses on real-world applications of NLP models.

This course is addressed to data scientists and machine learning engineers who
need to learn quickly how to take advantage of cutting edge NLP research
on their workplace.

**Note**: This is not a course for beginners in Machine Learning.
I assume the following:
- You know what a neural network is.
- You are familiar with the Python language. You do not need to
be proficient.
- You have implemented at least one neural network model yourself (even a simple 1-layer
dense network) using either PyTorch of Tensorflow. You do not need to be proficient
in any of these 2 frameworks.


## 1. Basic concepts in modern NLP

- Word embeddings.
- Sentence embeddings.
- Deep learning model architectures

    - LSTM
    - ELMO
    - BERT
    - OpenGPT

## 2. Deep learning models for NLP


## 3. Crash course on PyTorch


## 4. Fine-tunning NLP models


## 5. Professional deployment of models

- Initial title: Practical NLP course: from zero to hero.
It is too ambitious.
